# Sound-to-Text Conversion with OpenAI

This script allows you to record audio from any active app on your system, convert the sound into text, and get answers from OpenAI's language model. 
The question and answer are displayed in a Tkinter GUI.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- tkinter
- ffmpeg
- speech_recognition
- openai

Use the package manager [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/) to install the required packages.

## OpenAI API Key
To use the OpenAI language model, you need to set up an API key. Follow the instructions provided by OpenAI to get your API key. 
Once you have the key, replace `'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'` with your actual API key in the script.

## Usage

1. Run the script using the following command:
   python3 script.py
   script: test_tkinter2.py
